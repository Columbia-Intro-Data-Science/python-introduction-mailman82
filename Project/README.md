This is the File location for all the End of Year Project items for 4990 - Intro to Data Science
The website created is:
http://mailman82.pythonanywhere.com/

SQL is used in the code to store the raw data and pull into dataframes - I forgot to mention in the video

The presentation of the app is on youtube:

The final python code is in the file "flask_app.py"

The code is translated into an ipython notebook called "CHS Housing Infra Project.ipynb" - this code runs in the ipythonnotebook but the outputs are not consistent with the website (due to flask/html changes)

I also converted all of the raw HTML code to pdf and uploaded as well.
